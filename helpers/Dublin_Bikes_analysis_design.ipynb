        "\n",
        "**What factors affect the availability of bikes at DublinBikes stations over time and across locations in Dublin city?**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Theory & Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Bike-sharing systems are influenced by both temporal and spatial dynamics. We expect that the number of available bikes at a station fluctuates based on:\n",
        "- **Time of day** (commute vs. non-commute hours),\n",
        "- **Day of the week** (weekday vs. weekend),\n",
        "- **Station location** (central vs. residential),\n",
        "- **Station size** (number of stands).\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to explore whether these factors are significantly associated with the number of available bikes at a given time.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. **H1: Time of day affects bike availability.**  \n",
        "   We expect bike availability to drop during morning and evening rush hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **H2: Bike availability differs between weekdays and weekends.**  \n",
        "   Weekend patterns may differ from weekday commuting behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **H3: Stations with more stands tend to have more available bikes.**  \n",
        "   Larger stations may be more heavily stocked.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **H4: Average bike availability significantly differs between stations.**  \n",
        "   Central vs. suburban station usage may vary.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **H5: There is an interaction between day type and time of day.**  \n",
        "   Demand patterns by hour might vary between weekdays and weekends.\n"
